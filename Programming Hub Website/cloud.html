        <p class="sectionsubTag " >Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. <br> Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each location being a data center.<br> Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence[clarification needed] and economies of scale, typically using a "pay-as-you-go" model which can help in reducing capital expenses but may also lead to unexpected operating expenses for unaware users.

                Advocates of public and hybrid clouds note that cloud computing allows companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs. <br> Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and that it enables IT teams to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand, providing the burst computing capability: high computing power at certain periods of peak demand.

                <p class="sectionsubTag ">References to the phrase "cloud computing" appeared as early as 1996, with the first known mention in a Compaq internal document.[8]

                    <br> The cloud symbol was used to represent networks of computing equipment in the original ARPANET by as early as 1977,[9] and the CSNET by 1981[10]—both predecessors to the Internet itself.  <br>The word cloud was used as a metaphor for the Internet and a standardized cloud-like shape was used to denote a network on telephony schematics. <br> With this simplification, the implication is that the specifics of how the endpoints of a network are connected are not relevant to understanding the diagram.[11]
                    
                    <br> The term cloud was used to refer to platforms for distributed computing as early as 1993, <br> when Apple spin-off General Magic and AT&T used it in describing their (paired) Telescript and PersonaLink technologies.[12] <br> In Wired's April 1994 feature "Bill and Andy's Excellent Adventure II", Andy Hertzfeld commented on Telescript, General Magic's distributed programming language:
                    
                    <br> "The beauty of Telescript ... is that now, instead of just having a device to program, we now have the entire Cloud out there, where a single program can go and travel to many different sources of information and create a sort of a virtual service. <br> No one had conceived that before. The example Jim White [the designer of Telescript, X.400 and ASN.1] <br> uses now is a date-arranging service where a software agent goes to the flower store and orders flowers and then goes to the ticket shop and gets the tickets for the show, and everything is communicated to both parties."[13]

                    <p class="sectionTag"><h2>Cloud computing exhibits the following key characteristics:</h2></p>
                    <p class="sectionsubTag ">

                        Agility for organizations may be improved, as cloud computing may increase users' flexibility with re-provisioning, adding, or expanding technological infrastructure resources.<br><br>
                        Cost reductions are claimed by cloud providers.<br><br> A public-cloud delivery model converts capital expenditures (e.g., buying servers) to operational expenditure.[52] <br><br>This purportedly lowers barriers to entry, as infrastructure is typically provided by a third party and need not be purchased for one-time or infrequent intensive computing tasks.<br><br> Pricing on a utility computing basis is "fine-grained", with usage-based billing options. As well, less in-house IT skills are required for implementation of projects that use cloud computing.[53]<br><br> The e-FISCAL project's state-of-the-art repository[54] contains several articles looking into cost aspects in more detail, most of them concluding that costs savings depend on the type of activities supported and the type of infrastructure available in-house.
                        <br><br>Device and location independence[55] enable users to access systems using a web browser regardless of their location or what device they use (e.g., PC, mobile phone). As infrastructure is off-site (typically provided by a third-party) and accessed via the Internet, users can connect to it from anywhere.[53]
                        <br><br>Maintenance of cloud environment is easier because the data is hosted on an outside server maintained by a provider without the need to invest in data center hardware.<br><br> IT maintenance of cloud computing is managed and updated by the cloud provider's IT maintenance team that reduces cloud computing costs compared with the on-premises data centers.
                        <br><br>Multitenancy enables sharing of resources and costs across a large pool of users thus allowing for:
                        centralization of infrastructure in locations with lower costs (such as real estate, electricity, etc.)
                        <br><br> peak-load capacity increases (users need not engineer and pay for the resources and equipment to meet their highest possible load-levels)
                        utilisation and efficiency improvements for systems that are often only 10–20% utilised.[56][57]
                        <br><br> Performance is monitored by IT experts from the service provider, and consistent and loosely coupled architectures are constructed using web services as the system interface.[53][58]
                        <br><br> Productivity may be increased when multiple users can work on the same data simultaneously, rather than waiting for it to be saved and emailed. Time may be saved as information does not need to be re-entered when fields are matched, nor do users need to install application software upgrades to their computer.[59]
                        <br><br>Availability improves with the use of multiple redundant sites, which makes well-designed cloud computing suitable for business continuity and disaster recovery.[60]
                        <br><br>Scalability and elasticity via dynamic ("on-demand") provisioning of resources on a fine-grained, self-service basis in near real-time[61][62] (Note, the VM startup time varies by VM type, location, OS and cloud providers[61]), without users having to engineer for peak loads.[63][64][65]  <br>
                        <br>This gives the ability to scale up when the usage need increases or down if resources are not being used.[66] <br>
                        <br> <br>
                        <br> The time-efficient benefit of cloud scalability also means faster time to market, more business flexibility, and adaptability, as adding new resources doesn’t take as much time as it used to.[67] Emerging approaches for managing elasticity include the use of machine learning techniques to propose efficient elasticity models.[68]
                        <br><br>Security can improve due to centralization of data, increased security-focused resources, etc., but concerns can persist about loss of control over certain sensitive data, and the lack of security for stored kernels. <br><br>Security is often as good as or better than other traditional systems, in part because service providers are able to devote resources to solving security issues that many customers cannot afford to tackle or which they lack the technical skills to address.[69] However, the complexity of security is greatly increased when data is distributed over a wider area or over a greater number of devices, as well as in multi-tenant systems shared by unrelated users. In addition, user access to security audit logs may be difficult or impossible. Private cloud installations are in part motivated by users' desire to retain control over the infrastructure and avoid losing control of information security.

                        <p class="sectionsubTag ">*Private cloud: <br>
                            Private cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, whether managed internally or by a third party, and hosted either internally or externally.[70] Undertaking a private cloud project requires significant engagement to virtualize the business environment, and requires the organization to reevaluate decisions about existing resources. It can improve business, but every step in the project raises security issues that must be addressed to prevent serious vulnerabilities. Self-run data centers[92] are generally capital intensive. They have a significant physical footprint, requiring allocations of space, hardware, and environmental controls. These assets have to be refreshed periodically, resulting in additional capital expenditures. They have attracted criticism because users "still have to buy, build, and manage them" and thus do not benefit from less hands-on management,[93] essentially "[lacking] the economic model that makes cloud computing such an intriguing concept".[94][95]

                            For a comparison of cloud-computing software and providers, see Cloud-computing comparison
                            Cloud services are considered "public" when they are delivered over the public Internet, and they may be offered as a paid subscription, or free of charge.[96]  <br>Architecturally, there are few differences between public- and private-cloud services, but security concerns increase substantially when services (applications, storage, and other resources) are shared by multiple customers. Most public-cloud providers offer direct-connection services that allow customers to securely link their legacy data centers to their cloud-resident applications.[53][97]
                            
                            <br> Several factors like the functionality of the solutions, cost, integrational and organizational aspects as well as safety & security are influencing the decision of enterprises and organizations to choose a public cloud or on-premises solution.[98]
                            <br>
                            <br>*Hybrid cloud: <br>
                            Hybrid cloud is a composition of a public cloud and a private environment, such as a private cloud or on-premises resources,[99][100] that remain distinct entities but are bound together, offering the benefits of multiple deployment models.  <br>Hybrid cloud can also mean the ability to connect collocation, managed and/or dedicated services with cloud resources.[70]  <br>Gartner defines a hybrid cloud service as a cloud computing service that is composed of some combination of private, public and community cloud services, from different service providers.[101] <br> A hybrid cloud service crosses isolation and provider boundaries so that it can't be simply put in one category of private, public, or community cloud service. <br> It allows one to extend either the capacity or the capability of a cloud service, by aggregation, integration or customization with another cloud service.
                            
                            <br> Varied use cases for hybrid cloud composition exist. <br> For example, an organization may store sensitive client data in house on a private cloud application, but interconnect that application to a business intelligence application provided on a public cloud as a software service.[102]  <br>This example of hybrid cloud extends the capabilities of the enterprise to deliver a specific business service through the addition of externally available public cloud services.  <br>Hybrid cloud adoption depends on a number of factors such as data security and compliance requirements, level of control needed over data, and the applications an organization uses.[103]
                            
                            <br>Another example of hybrid cloud is one where IT organizations use public cloud computing resources to meet temporary capacity needs that can not be met by the private cloud.[104]  <br>This capability enables hybrid clouds to employ cloud bursting for scaling across clouds.[70] <br> Cloud bursting is an application deployment model in which an application runs in a private cloud or data center and "bursts" to a public cloud when the demand for computing capacity increases. <br> A primary advantage of cloud bursting and a hybrid cloud model is that an organization pays for extra compute resources only when they are needed.[105] <br> Cloud bursting enables data centers to create an in-house IT infrastructure that supports average workloads, and use cloud resources from public or private clouds, during spikes in processing demands.[106]  <br>The specialized model of hybrid cloud, which is built atop heterogeneous hardware, is called "Cross-platform Hybrid Cloud". <br> A cross-platform hybrid cloud is usually powered by different CPU architectures, for example, x86-64 and ARM, underneath. <br> Users can transparently deploy and scale applications without knowledge of the cloud's hardware diversity.[107] <br> This kind of cloud emerges from the rise of ARM-based system-on-chip for server-class computing.
                            <br>
                            <br>Hybrid cloud infrastructure essentially serves to eliminate limitations inherent to the multi-access relay characteristics of private cloud networking. <br> The advantages include enhanced runtime flexibility and adaptive memory processing unique to virtualized interface models.[108]
