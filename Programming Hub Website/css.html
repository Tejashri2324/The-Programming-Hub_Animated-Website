        <p class="sectionsubTag " >We all have heard about Computer Programming gaining a lot of popularity in the past 3 decades. So many students these days want to opt for a Computer Science stream in order to get a job at their dream tech company - Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and whatnot.

            What is Programming?
            In this blog post, we will decipher the term “programming” and understand its usage and many other related terms.
            
            Understanding Programming in layman terms
            Programming is a way to “instruct the computer to perform various tasks”.
            
            Confusing? Let us understand the definition deeply.“Instruct the computer”: this basically means that you provide the computer a set of instructions that are written in a language that the computer can understand. The instructions could be of various types. For example:

            Adding 2 numbers,
            Rounding off a number, etc.
            Just like we humans can understand a few languages (English, Spanish, Mandarin, French, etc.), so is the case with computers. Computers understand instructions that are written in a specific syntactical form called a programming language.
            
            “Perform various tasks”: the tasks could be simple ones like we discussed above (adding 2 numbers, rounding off a number) or complex ones which may involve a sequence of multiple instructions. For example:
            
            Calculating simple interest, given principal, rate and time.Calculating the average return on a stock over the last 5 years.
            The above 2 tasks require complex calculations. They cannot usually be expressed in simple instructions like adding 2 numbers, etc.
            
            Hence, in summary, Programming is a way to tell computers to do a specific task.

            <p class="sectionTag"><h2>Why should you bother about coding?</h2></p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag ">
                You must be wondering - why does one need a computer for adding or rounding off numbers? Or even for simple interest calculation? After all, even an 8th standard kid can easily do such things even over large numbers. What is programming used for? What benefits do computers offer?
                
                Well, computers offer so many benefits:
                
                Computers are fast: computers are amazingly fast. If you know how to properly utilize the power of Computer programming, you can do wonders with it. For a typical computer of today’s time, an addition of 2 numbers which could be as big as a billion each takes hardly a nanosecond. Read again - nanosecond! That means that in 1 second, a computer can perform about a billion additions. Can any human ever do that? Forget a billion additions a second, typical human can’t even do 10 additions per second. So, computers offer great speed.
                Computers are cheap: if you were a stock market analyst and you had to monitor the data of say 1000 stocks so that you can quickly trade them. Imagine the hassle that would create if you were to do it manually! It is just impractical. While you are performing your calculation on the stock’s performance, the price may change. The other alternative is to hire people so that you can monitor more stocks in parallel. That means your cost goes up significantly. Not to mention the trouble you will face if some of your employees commit a calculation error in the process. You may end up losing money! Contrast that with the case where you use a computer. Computers can process a huge amount of information quickly and reliably.</p>
                1000 stocks are nothing for computers in the 21st century.
                Computers can work 24x7: Computers can work 24x7 without getting exhausted. So, if you have a task that is big enough, you can without worries allocate it to a computer by programming it and sleep peacefully.

                <p class="sectionsubTag ">As mentioned above, Computers understand instructions that are written in a specific syntactical form called a programming language. A programming language provides a way for a programmer to express a task so that it could be understood and executed by a computer. Refer our another blog-post "What is programming language?" to know more about programming languages. Some of the popular Programming languages are Python, C, C++, Java, etc.

                    Why should you learn Computer Programming?
                    Now, after knowing so many things about programming, the big question to be answered is - why should you learn Computer Programming? Let us understand why Programming is fun: Using Programming, you can create your own games, your personal blog/profile page, a social networking site like Facebook, a search engine like Google or an e-commerce platform like Amazon! Won’t that be fun? Imagine creating your own game and putting it on Play Store and getting thousands and thousands of downloads!
                    The backbone of a Technology Company: The backbones of today’s technology companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and many others, are giant computer programs written by a collaboration of thousands of skilled programmers. If you have the right business acumen, knowing programming can help you create the next big tech company.
                    Pretty good salary: Computer Programmers are paid extremely well almost all across the world. Top programmers in Silicon Valley make millions of dollars every year. Quite a few companies offer to start salaries as high as $100,000 per year.</p>

                    <p class="sectionsubTag ">Though Environment Setup is not an element of any Programming Language, it is the first step to be followed before setting on to write a program.

                        When we say Environment Setup, it simply implies a base on top of which we can do our programming. Thus, we need to have the required software setup, i.e., installation on our PC which will be used to write computer programs, compile, and execute them. For example, if you need to browse Internet, then you need the following setup on your machine −
                        
                        A working Internet connection to connect to the Internet
                        A Web browser such as Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari, etc.Text Editor
                        A text editor is a software that is used to write computer programs. Your Windows machine must have a Notepad.You can use this software to type your computer program and save it in a file at any location. You can download and install other good editors like Notepad++, which is freely available.

                        If you are a Mac user, then you will have TextEdit or you can install some other commercial editor like BBEdit to start with.</p>

                        <p class="sectionsubTag ">You write your computer program using your favorite programming language and save it in a text file called the program file.

                            Now let us try to get a little more detail on how the computer understands a program written by you using a programming language. Actually, the computer cannot understand your program directly given in the text format, so we need to convert this program in a binary format, which can be understood by the computer.
                            
                            The conversion from text program to binary file is done by another software called Compiler and this process of conversion from text formatted program to binary format file is called program compilation. Finally, you can execute binary file to perform the programmed task.
                            
                            We are not going into the details of a compiler and the different phases of compilation.So, if you are going to write your program in any such language, which needs compilation like C, C++, Java and Pascal, etc., then you will need to install their compilers before you start programming.</p>

                            <p class="sectionsubTag ">We just discussed about compilers and the compilation process. Compilers are required in case you are going to write your program in a programming language that needs to be compiled into binary format before its execution.

                                There are other programming languages such as Python, PHP, and Perl, which do not need any compilation into binary format, rather an interpreter can be used to read such programs line by line and execute them directly without any further conversion.So, if you are going to write your programs in PHP, Python, Perl, Ruby, etc., then you will need to install their interpreters before you start programming.

                                Online Compilation?
                                If you are not able to set up any editor, compiler, or interpreter on your machine, then tutorialspoint.com provides a facility to compile and run almost all the programs online with an ease of a single click.</p>
