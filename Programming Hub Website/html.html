        <p class="sectionsubTag " >HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most widely used language on Web to develop web pages. <br> HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML specification which was published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was published in late 1999.  <br>Though HTML 4.01 version is widely used but currently we are having HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and this version was published in 2012.

            <p class="sectionsubTag ">
                Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers. Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available in HTML language.
<br>
HTML is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning HTML:
<br>
Create Web site - You can create a website or customize an existing web template if you know HTML well.
<br>
Become a web designer - If you want to start a carrer as a professional web designer, HTML and CSS designing is a must skill.
<br>
Understand web - If you want to optimize your website, to boost its speed and performance, it is good to know HTML to yield best results.
<br>
Learn other languages - Once you understands the basic of HTML then other related technologies like javascript, php, or angular are become easier to understand.

                <p class="sectionsubTag ">As mentioned before, HTML is one of the most widely used language over the web. I'm going to list few of them here:
<br>
                    *Web pages development -<br> HTML is used to create pages which are rendered over the web. Almost every page of web is having html tags in it to render its details in browser.
                    <br>
                    *Internet Navigation - <br>HTML provides tags which are used to navigate from one page to another and is heavily used in internet navigation.
                    <br>
                  *Responsive UI - <br>HTML pages now-a-days works well on all platform, mobile, tabs, desktop or laptops owing to responsive design strategy.
                  <br>
                    *Offline support HTML pages once loaded can be made available offline on the machine without any need of internet.
                    <br>
                    *Game development- <br>HTML5 has native support for rich experience and is now useful in gaming developent arena as well.

                        <p class="sectionsubTag ">You write your computer program using your favorite programming language and save it in a text file called the program file.

                            Now let us try to get a little more detail on how the computer understands a program written by you using a programming language. Actually, the computer cannot understand your program directly given in the text format, so we need to convert this program in a binary format, which can be understood by the computer.
                            
                            The conversion from text program to binary file is done by another software called Compiler and this process of conversion from text formatted program to binary format file is called program compilation. Finally, you can execute binary file to perform the programmed task.
                            
                            We are not going into the details of a compiler and the different phases of compilation.So, if you are going to write your program in any such language, which needs compilation like C, C++, Java and Pascal, etc., then you will need to install their compilers before you start programming.</p>

                            <p class="sectionTag"><h2>What Is Interpreter?</h2></p>
                            <p class="sectionsubTag ">We just discussed about compilers and the compilation process. Compilers are required in case you are going to write your program in a programming language that needs to be compiled into binary format before its execution.

                                There are other programming languages such as Python, PHP, and Perl, which do not need any compilation into binary format, rather an interpreter can be used to read such programs line by line and execute them directly without any further conversion.So, if you are going to write your programs in PHP, Python, Perl, Ruby, etc., then you will need to install their interpreters before you start programming.

                                If you are not able to set up any editor, compiler, or interpreter on your machine, then tutorialspoint.com provides a facility to compile and run almost all the programs online with an ease of a single click.</p>
