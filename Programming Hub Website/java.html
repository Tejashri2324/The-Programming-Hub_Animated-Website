            Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995.  <br> James Gosling is known as the father of Java.   <br>Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java. </p>

                Application
                According to Sun, 3 billion devices run Java. There are many devices where Java is currently used. Some of them are as follows:
                <br>
                1.Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc.
                <br>
                2.Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com, etc.
                <br>
                3.Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.
                <br>
                4.Mobile
                <br>
                5.Embedded System
                <br>
                6.Smart Card

                <p class="sectionTag"><h2>Types Of Java Programming</h2></p>
                <p class="sectionsubTag ">There are mainly 4 types of applications that can be created using Java programming:
<br>
                    1) Standalone Application:<br>
                    Standalone applications are also known as desktop applications or window-based applications. These are traditional software that we need to install on every machine. Examples of standalone application are Media player, antivirus, etc. AWT and Swing are used in Java for creating standalone applications.
                    <br>
                    2) Web Application:<br>
                    An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is called a web application. Currently, Servlet, JSP, Struts, Spring, Hibernate, JSF, etc. technologies are used for creating web applications in Java.
                    <br>
                    3) Enterprise Application:<br>
                    An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications, etc. is called an enterprise application. It has advantages like high-level security, load balancing, and clustering. In Java, EJB is used for creating enterprise applications.
                    <br>
                    4) Mobile Application:<br>
                    An application which is created for mobile devices is called a mobile application. Currently, Android and Java ME are used for creating mobile applications.

                    <p class="sectionsubTag ">Java Platforms / Editions
                        There are 4 platforms or editions of Java: 
                        <br>
                        1) Java SE (Java Standard Edition):  <br>
                        It is a Java programming platform. It includes Java programming APIs such as java.lang, java.io, java.net, java.util, java.sql, java.math etc. It includes core topics like OOPs, String, Regex, Exception, Inner classes, Multithreading, I/O Stream, Networking, AWT, Swing, Reflection, Collection, etc.
                        
                        2) Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition):  <br>
                        It is an enterprise platform that is mainly used to develop web and enterprise applications. It is built on top of the Java SE platform. It includes topics like Servlet, JSP, Web Services, EJB, JPA, etc.
                        <br>
                        3) Java ME (Java Micro Edition):  <br>
                        It is a micro platform that is dedicated to mobile applications.
                        <br>
                        4) JavaFX:  <br>
                        It is used to develop rich internet applications. It uses a lightweight user interface API.

                            <p class="sectionTag"><h2>What Is Interpreter?</h2></p>
                            <p class="sectionsubTag ">We just discussed about compilers and the compilation process. Compilers are required in case you are going to write your program in a programming language that needs to be compiled into binary format before its execution.

                                There are other programming languages such as Python, PHP, and Perl, which do not need any compilation into binary format, rather an interpreter can be used to read such programs line by line and execute them directly without any further conversion.So, if you are going to write your programs in PHP, Python, Perl, Ruby, etc., then you will need to install their interpreters before you start programming.

                                Online Compilation?
                                If you are not able to set up any editor, compiler, or interpreter on your machine, then tutorialspoint.com provides a facility to compile and run almost all the programs online with an ease of a single click.</p>
